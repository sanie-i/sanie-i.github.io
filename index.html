              <p>Little boxes on the hillside<br>
              Little boxes made of ticky tacky<br>
              Little boxes, little boxes<br>
              Little boxes all the same.<br>
              — Malvina Reynolds, 1962.</p>

              <p>Here is another primitive hut.<sup>1</sup> It measures approximately two by two meters in area. It’s built with rough limestone blocks and corrugated metal roofing. Sometimes it has a door and window, other times simply a doorway. It is solid, heavy, resolutely present but — curiously and crucially — empty.</p>

              <p>Such huts can be found in many abandoned fields throughout Crimea, the Russian-occupied peninsula in Ukraine, built in rough but consistent grids. Elementary and crude in form, the hut is highly intricate in function, embodied and embedded within a web of histories of displacement and global geopolitical forces. It’s made especially complex by Russian annexation and the ongoing war in Ukraine. But the hut’s story begins elsewhere:</p>

              <p>On May 18, 1944, by order No. 5859SS issued by Joseph Stalin, the entire population of ethnic Crimean Tatars, the people indigenous to Crimea, were forcefully taken from their homes, loaded into cattle trains and deported from the Crimean territory to Central Asia and Siberia, with the majority sent to Uzbekistan. Although most frequently called ‘the deportation,’ the death toll from executions, the weeks-long train trip and the following harsh living conditions, forced labor, poverty, starvation and disease in exile, have prompted several governments and political bodies to officially denounce it as genocide.<sup>2</sup></p>

              <p>Crimeans<sup>3</sup> were prohibited from returning to their homeland until 1989. Attempts to enter the territory resulted in re-deportation to Uzbekistan or to forced labor camps. Upon the lifting of the ban, Crimeans returned en masse, finding their former homes and farms occupied by new owners, primarily of Russian or Ukrainian origin, moved into Crimea by Stalin to settle the confiscated land. Abandoning longstanding legal appeals to compensation or reparation, Crimeans adopted a strategy of illegally occupying vacant areas of land by building small huts as signifiers of claimed territory. As the practice became increasingly widespread, these huts quickly entered the vernacular of the local landscape, and the squatted lands became known as <em>polyany protesta</em> — Fields of Protest, or Protest Fields.</p>

            <button class="collapsible">01 <span>The Hut</span></button>
            <div class="content">
              <p>The hut is a provisional, liminal thing. It’s not built to house anyone — its primary function is that of a placeholder. It’s built in hope of obtaining legal rights to the claimed territory, taking advantage of local property and squatting laws.</p>

              <p>It goes one of two ways: A lengthy bureaucratic process is launched, which takes at minimum several years, with the ultimate aim of obtaining official property registration. The granting of legal status is highly contingent on local politics, property values and, more recently,<sup>4</sup> on larger geopolitical considerations from the Kremlin. In the meantime, the hut acts as a stand-in for property claim. Alternatively or concurrently, a larger house is built up illegally, with the hut acting as a tool shed, workshop and storage space for construction. In collaborative effort with neighboring hut-builders within the protest field, unofficial road, sewage, water and electricity infrastructures are developed over time, sometimes in informal collaboration with local authorities and providers. In both cases, the huts, and the associated larger structures, remain under risk of being demolished by local authorities, often resulting in clashes between the protesters and the police. They become, to slightly misuse Hito Steyerl’s term, ‘zones of terminal impermanence,’ existing in the grey areas of both the law and the home.</p>

              <p>As a house, the hut is both absurd and rather convincing. Like a crude drawing by a kid asked to draw a home. It’s the idea of a home, its potentiality. While its status is shaky, its material properties are decisively substantial. It’s average size ranges from 1.5-4 meters in width and 2.4-2.7 meters in height, depending on material and funding availability. It’s capped with cheap corrugated metal roofing. It may or may not have a foundation. The main structure is built from locally sourced limestone blocks. Notably, mortar is not always used — some huts are built up simply by stacking the blocks, further underscoring the unstable, placeholder quality of the hut.</p>

              <p>Let’s pause here for a moment. Limestone, CaCO<sub>3</sub>, ракушечник: a porous sedimentary rock, composed primarily of calcite, formed from organic debris in shallow marine waters. Accumulating on the Black Sea bottom for an average of 550 million years, shell, coral, algal, fecal and other organic deposits turn into solid stone. Crimea is rich in large deposits of exposed limestone — its abundance, easy extraction and low transportation cost make it the cheapest available building material. In building the protest hut, the material is extracted directly from the local natural landscape and is then (re)used or reinserted as part of the built landscape. The stuff, the substance of the land becomes the very medium of reclaiming it. The act of building the hut becomes a literal grounding. A material composed of remnants of life forms much older than the human species and our peculiar capacity of reorganizing matter — the hut calls to a power of a different kind. This renders our territory disputes and the lines we draw in the sand rather silly, on the one hand. On the other, the hut becomes a bond between a people’s situated history and the primacy of ground, somewhere between the micro scale of the calcite molecule and the macro scale of geological time, the molecular and the planetary. “In the pores of those vast dramas of class and party, nation and history…It’s a question of being able to perceive both molar drama and molecular gesture together.”</p>

              <p>
              By comparing the Crimean tactic of protest fields to other methods of claiming space, we will discover
              the parallels and contrasts between these subversive practices and the strange intimacy shared by power
              and space. The fields, as a form of protest architecture, exist within the history of occupation as protest.
              They are a strategy of (re)claiming space and challenging authority, borders and ownership. A previous
              significant example of protest constructions that operate strategically on the level of the street or the
              built environment is the barricade. As military-strategic constructions, barricades were notably implemented
              in Paris throughout the period of 1795- 1871 and re-emerged in 1945-1968. While barricades “were not the first
              or the last artefacts of urban insurgency,” they provide a useful lens through which to read the Crimean
              protest tactic.<a class="sup" href="#footnote13">13</a> As state military technology diminished the strategic advantage of the barricade, these
              objects of urban warfare became symbolic structures through their re-enactment and ritualization. As Carl Douglas articulates:
              </p>
              <p class="q">
              [Traugott] argues that barricading became, with each repetition, an increasingly ritualised act loaded with ‘symbolic
              and sociological functions.’ Each new instance of barricading was also a re-enactment of previous barricades. During
              the Paris Commune, the Communards were eager to have themselves photographed with their barricades. In doing this,
              they reinforced the spectacular and performative nature of their constructions.<a class="sup" href="#footnote14">14</a>
              </p>
              <p>
              Similarly, the Crimean protest fields originally came out of an immediate need for shelter and belonging, and later became
              largely symbolic acts and protest tools through repetition, collective action and changes in the criminal code.
              </p>
              <p>
              The practice began as a collective effort of squatting and land-grabbing, known colloquially as self-seizing (samo-zahvat).
              It initially involved constructing tent cities where, “men, women, and even adult children shared the tasks and implemented
              a division of labor to achieve their common goal.”<a class="sup" href="#footnote15">15</a>  A former Crimean resident articulates the origins of the practice in the early 1990’s:
              </p>
              <p class="q">
              It was a mess. In agriculture, economy. Generally, there was a great deal of empty land, just like that. It started with people
              putting up tents, living there, and protesting. They cooked food, they lived right in the tents - in the spring, in the summer,
              in the autumn, when it is warm. And the authorities did not seem to react. So, on this field, people would start to divide the
              land and build. If a year has passed, year and a half, and none has reacted, people would start building houses (the ones who
              have money). Where the land is expensive, of strategic purpose, or if the authorities have plans for it, it would happen that
              the police would immediately drive up, with bulldozers, and begin to demolish it all. Several times there were severe
              confrontations, almost leading to fatalities.<a class="sup" href="#footnote16">16</a>
              </p>
              <p>
              The tactic evolved when a new version of the Criminal Code of Ukraine was adopted in 2003, introducing retroactively
              effective punishments “including fines, two years of forced work, and imprisonment—for squatting on land in Crimea.
              Moreover, special amendments to the Ukrainian Law on Militia authorized the use of dogs, chemicals, and special arms
              for the purpose of “preventing” or “liquidating” mass squatting.”<a class="sup" href="#footnote17">17</a>  In response, the Crimean occupiers renamed their
              practice from self-seizing to protest fields and continued squatting.<a class="sup" href="#footnote18">18</a>  Consequentially, the practice transformed from physically inhabiting the
              fields to simply building huts as signifiers of claimed land. Thus, the effectiveness of the built hut, as in the
              case of the barricade, shifted to rest in its performative role and symbolic function.
              </p>
              <p>
              While both barricades and protest fields are tools to claim space and challenge authorities, there
              are crucial differences between the methods. The barricades serve as barriers and obstacles, aiming to
              restrict or control physical movement, whereas protest huts signify occupation. More importantly, the
              barricades are used in inevitably violent urban warfare and are intentionally disruptive in their use and
              construction, while Crimean occupiers are intent on acting by peaceful means, and ultimately
              reproducing the safety of home. Historically, Crimeans maintain a focus on nonviolent methods of
              political protest, such as hunger strikes, organized letter-writing and public meetings and demonstrations,
              including a sit-in in Moscow’s Red Square in 1987.<a class="sup" href="#footnote19">19</a><a class="sup" href="#footnote20">20</a>
              </p>
              <p>
              We can find a comparable adherence to nonviolent tactics in Reclaim the Streets (RTS) – a
              practice that exemplifies counter-hegemonic protest through the occupation of lived space. RTS began in
              London in 1995 as part of the anti-road building movement that used the occupation of the built
              environment as a direct, non-violent action against car culture. Their tactic was to reclaim the streets of
              London by engaging in festivals, street parties or raves. Their acts blocked the road to vehicles and thus
              served as direct, bodily protest against the car. This offered “a prefigurative vision of what city streets
              could be in a system that prioritized people over profit and ecology over the economy.”<a class="sup" href="#footnote21">21</a> Another parallel
              can be found in the Occupy Wall Street movement which peaked in 2011. As stated by a former protester
              in Occupy Wall Street, “often the tactics of occupation generally serve two functions: to disrupt the
              working order, or to make visible a hidden grievance.”<a class="sup" href="#footnote22">22</a> The protest field strategy clearly and vividly
              fulfills the latter function – the huts dot the fields of Crimea as monuments that make visible historically
              persistent acts of violence, injustice and pain, thus inscribing protest onto the landscape. Meanwhile, the
              strategy’s role in disrupting the established order is more complex and requires closer examination.
              Crimean occupiers are disrupting the established order while simultaneously trying to inscribe themselves
              within it. Their prefigurative vision is not that of a revolution, nor of a Utopia; it does not aim to
              overthrow the state or the working order. Instead, it is a vision of inclusion into the existing social fabric,
              of space claimed within it.

              The fields’ formal and spatial configuration exhibits a strong bond to the prevailing organization of space.
              Rather than proposing new models of constructing or experiencing the built environment, as in the case of RTS,
              Crimean occupiers are desperately trying to recreate present authorized forms of settlement. By adhering to a
              strict grid-like, repeatable and uniform planning, they informally duplicate the typical act of subdivision used
              in contemporary official housing development. In this aerial view <a class="fig" href="#figure2">[Figure 2]</a>, we can recognize the protest
              field as an act of filling in, as a logical continuation of the surrounding authorized residential parcels.
              </p>
              <p>
              This monotonous construction of housing emerges in stark contrast to a lost vernacular architectural diversity
              that once prevailed in the territory. Prior to the annexation of Crimea by the Russian Empire in 1783, the Crimean
              built environment exhibited great irregularity in planning and architecture, due to the variability of local
              landscape and the influence of different Crimean tribes, such as the Tats, Nogais and Yaliboyu.<a class="sup" href="#footnote23">23</a> Crimeans traditionally
              built homes congruent with the landscape forms and irregularities. For example, the nineteenth-century traveler
              Edward Clarke described the mountain Crimeans’ tendency to have their dwellings buried in foliage, while other
              travelers mentioned their “habit of building their houses into the earth on the sides of terraced mountains.”<a class="sup" href="#footnote24">24</a>
              The steppe regions of Crimea featured irregular streets and arrangement of housing.<a class="sup" href="#footnote25">25</a> The coastal zones in the south
              were distinguished by disorderly, multi-level structures, which included “crooked stone staircases in
              narrow spaces between houses, which [were] piled one above the other; the courtyard [was] sometimes
              located directly on the roof of the underlying house.”<a class="sup" href="#footnote26">26</a>
              </p>
              <p>
              Russian rule significantly disrupted the peninsula’s existing architectural development, which is
              most dramatically evident in Muslim religious architecture. Mass destruction of monuments and
              mosques, as well as a discontinuance of state funding, resulted in a severe decline in the development
              and typological diversity of local religious constructions.<a class="sup" href="#footnote27">27</a> Tsarist repression of the peninsula’s Muslim
              faith also resulted in mass (forced and willing) emigrations of Crimeans, for whom national identity was
              tied strongly to religion rather than territory. In fact, a coherent Crimean identify was formulated
              precisely in response to the foreign invasion, as the local tribes began to develop a sense of political,
              cultural and linguistic unity. Moreover, the very concept of territorially-bound national identity was
              imported from the Russian Empire:
              </p>
              <p class="q">
              Prior to the late 19th century, there had been no well-articulated political theory among the
              Crimean Tatars which proclaimed their unique claim to, and identification with a particular
              unit as a national homeland…Bernard Lewis writes, ‘The use of the word watan (Turkish
              vatan) in a political sense, equivalent to the French patrie…dates from the late eighteenth
              century, and is clearly due to European influence and example.’<a class="sup" href="#footnote28">28</a>
              </p>
              <p>
              Younger generations of Tatars, educated and inspired by Russian intelligentsia and nationalists, promoted the
              attachment of national identity to the physical landscape of the Crimean Peninsula. This territorial identification
              was carried through and further consolidated during the Soviet rule, until the 1944 deportation, which marked a
              decisive severing of a direct connection to the land.
              </p>
              <p>
              The diversity that was once expressed through architecture became a sort of outside entity, which, upon return, began to
              express itself in a uniform way. The typical execution of a protest field remains as follows: first, a group of Crimeans
              is formed, usually from residents of the same village, living in multi-family houses. Then, as one ethnic Crimean describes:
              </p>
              <p class="q">
              They choose a neighbouring field and there they go, spontaneously – no one would touch a crowd. 100 people. They make
              arrangements and negotiate and go, with measuring tapes, with ropes, pegs, axes, hammers – they reach the field and start:
              so, here will be the street, and here will be plots of 6 or 8 acres. Measure and divide, measure and divide. They position the pegs,
              tie the ropes. And immediately, so that everything would not be demolished, they start to deliver the stone and build the huts –
              everything is done in a few days, a week maximum. Before the authorities come to their senses.<a class="sup" href="#footnote29">29</a>
              </p>
              <p>
              What results is a rough but often consistent grid of huts. Depending on the situation, full houses are gradually built up in
              place of the huts, roads are made, or the field can remain in this starting state for months or years. The constructed grid
              of even lots and uniform dwellings appear as ghosts of a once rich diversity. Crimean occupiers’ informal re-enactment of
              residential subdivision and their appropriation of urban planning vocabulary are pleas for acceptance and integration into
              the working order. At the same time, through this massive collective effort, they are taking over the role of the official
              property developer. Thus, their aims to include themselves into an established cultural fabric become acts capable of
              disrupting or reconstituting social dynamics.
              </p>
              <p>
              The recent annexation of the Crimean Peninsula from Ukraine by the Russian Federation in 2014, profoundly complicates
              the protest field strategy’s social, political and symbolic significance. In the currently Russian-occupied territory,
              the protest field becomes an increasingly loaded act, charged with multiple levels of tragedy and experience of displacement.
              It is now not only a protest against a former abuse and an absence of reparation, but a simultaneous counter-occupation on a
              micro scale, engaging with multiple layers of violence.
              </p>
              <p>
              The Crimean Tatar strategy of claiming land through constructing protest fields in the Crimean territory is both a subversive
              practice and a plea for acceptance into the established order. The protest huts function as monuments, placeholders for
              completeness, performative acts of disruption and nonviolent tactics of claiming a home. By inscribing protest onto the local
              landscape, Crimeans are attempting to create security on the levels of the body, the shelter, and the territory. The fields
              operate simultaneously within the realms of the physical (material, bodily, structural), the symbolic and the social/political.
              Displacement, placelessness, and precarity are well recognized conditions of the current moment. Histories of displacement, as
              well as strategies to counter them form the everyday of our landscape. There is clear urgency for new and constantly evolving
              strategies to reclaim agency within our built environment.
