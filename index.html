            <p>A plot of land divided into lots and populated with generic, repeating boxes is a familiar product of contemporary built space.
              The landscape of Crimea, Ukraine is replete with such spaces – grass fields dotted with standardized stone dwellings arranged in
              a rough but consistent grid. They are called protest fields. They result from a practice of unauthorized occupation of land in the
              Crimean territory, as a reaction to historically consistent acts of violence and displacement. They are a form of resistance, a
              practice of inscribing protest onto a landscape, a way of laying claim to a home and a homeland. This text investigates the strategy
              of constructing protest fields as a subversive practice and as a plea for acceptance into the established order. By drawing
              connections to other forms of protest, such as the creation of barricades and urban occupation movements, the Crimean tactic
              is situated within the scales of the body, the shelter and the territory. The protest fields are examined both as typical acts
              of subdivision and as symbolic acts capable of constituting new social dynamics.

            <p>
            The Primitive Hut, as articulated by Marc-Antoine Laugier in his Essai sur l'Architecture from 1753, holds its place
            in architectural theory as a highly influential archetype and concept of the Enlightenment. Laugier theorized the Primitive
             Hut as the origin and prototype of all built enclosures, as “the model upon which all the magnificences of architecture
             have been imagined.”<a class="sup" href="#footnote1">1</a> This crucial element in architectural history is introduced by Laugier through an account of “man in
             his first origin” seeking and ultimately crafting shelter from the harsh conditions of nature.<a class="sup" href="#footnote2">2</a> The Primitive Hut was
             valorized as a universal element of humanity to advocate a return to simplicity and rational, structural design
             (exemplified by Classical Orders), and emerged as a potent term in archeological and anthropological discourses.<a class="sup" href="#footnote3">3</a>
            </p>
            <p>
            Laugier’s hut resurfaced more than a century later within the ideas of Modernist architecture and
            planning.<a class="sup" href="#footnote4">4</a> The notion of the “primitive” and the Primitive Hut prototype has been widely critiqued and
            countered, by questioning the implications of a pursuit of origin, simple nature and elementary or
            universal forms, within the dominant architectural discourse in the West. Contemporary evocations of
            “primitive” huts, such as those in the Crimean Peninsula, are in fact far from primitive, instead embedded
            within a web of histories of displacement, social relations, economic conditions, and politics. In each
            instance, the formally crude or basic hut is not built as an isolated example of a single human engaged in
            battle with the natural world, as in Laugier’s fantasy. Instead, “the subject that builds is not an individual
            but a society, and consequently architecture is a technology not of shelter but of memory – a shared
            deposit of the unconscious.”<a class="sup" href="#footnote5">5</a>
            </p>
            <p>
            Similarly, although the hut discussed here is elementary and crude in form <a class="fig" href="#figure1">[Figure 1]</a>, it is highly intricate in
            function, serving complex social, political and symbolic purposes. Approximately two by two meters in
            perimeter, composed of rough limestone blocks and capped with corrugated metal roofing, such huts can
            be found in many abandoned fields throughout the Crimean Peninsula, Ukraine. They result from a
            practice of unauthorized occupation of land in the Crimean territory. They are a form of resistance, a
            practice of inscribing protest onto a landscape, a way of laying claim to a home, a homeland, a belonging,
            a voice.
            </p>
            <p>
            These spaces emerged in reaction to past and ongoing acts of military, political, economic,
            cultural, and religious oppression. On May 18, 1944, by order of Joseph Stalin, the entire population of
            ethnic Crimean Tatars were forcefully taken from their homes, loaded into freight trains and deported
            from the Crimean territory to Central Asia, with the majority sent to Uzbekistan.<a class="sup" href="#footnote6">6</a> Crimeans<a class="sup" href="#footnote7">7</a> were
            prohibited from returning to their homeland until 1989.<a class="sup" href="#footnote8">8</a> Upon the lifting of the ban, the masses of
            returning Crimeans found their former homes and land occupied by new owners, primarily of Russian or
            Ukrainian origin, most of whom had moved into the deserted peninsula after WWII.<a class="sup" href="#footnote9">9</a> Abandoning any
            hope of compensation or reparation, Crimeans adopted a strategy of illegally occupying vacant areas of
            land, often near major cities or resorts, by building small houses/huts/sheds as signifiers of claimed
            territory.<a class="sup" href="#footnote10">10</a> As the practice became increasingly widespread, these huts quickly entered the vernacular of
            the local landscape, and the squatted lands became known as <em>protest fields</em>.<a class="sup" href="#footnote11">11</a>
            </p>
            <p>
            The huts (colloquially known as “birdhouses” or “outhouses”) serve primarily as placeholders –
            they are built in hope of obtaining legal rights to the claimed territory or until proper funds are saved up
            to build a full house albeit illegally.<a class="sup" href="#footnote12">12</a> Their role is to occupy a space for a permanent home, under the risk
            of being demolished by local authorities. Therefore, while the huts are in fact functional shelters, they are
            rarely lived in. Typically, the act of squatting is a bodily act, which focuses on the body inhabiting a
            particular space or enclosure. In the case of the protest huts, the enclosure is not built to house anyone,
            but rather the structure itself takes on the function of a body inhabiting an environment. Thus, the hut is
            not only a stand-in for the potential home but also for the body. Its emptiness stands as a monument to
            displacement and the hope for a future completeness. The protest fields constructed throughout the Crimean
            territory are both acts of subversion and pleas for acceptance into the established order.

            <p>
            By comparing the Crimean tactic of protest fields to other methods of claiming space, we will discover
            the parallels and contrasts between these subversive practices and the strange intimacy shared by power
            and space. The fields, as a form of protest architecture, exist within the history of occupation as protest.
            They are a strategy of (re)claiming space and challenging authority, borders and ownership. A previous
            significant example of protest constructions that operate strategically on the level of the street or the
            built environment is the barricade. As military-strategic constructions, barricades were notably implemented
            in Paris throughout the period of 1795- 1871 and re-emerged in 1945-1968. While barricades “were not the first
            or the last artefacts of urban insurgency,” they provide a useful lens through which to read the Crimean
            protest tactic.<a class="sup" href="#footnote13">13</a> As state military technology diminished the strategic advantage of the barricade, these
            objects of urban warfare became symbolic structures through their re-enactment and ritualization. As Carl Douglas articulates:
            </p>
            <p class="q">
            [Traugott] argues that barricading became, with each repetition, an increasingly ritualised act loaded with ‘symbolic
            and sociological functions.’ Each new instance of barricading was also a re-enactment of previous barricades. During
            the Paris Commune, the Communards were eager to have themselves photographed with their barricades. In doing this,
            they reinforced the spectacular and performative nature of their constructions.<a class="sup" href="#footnote14">14</a>
            </p>
            <p>
            Similarly, the Crimean protest fields originally came out of an immediate need for shelter and belonging, and later became
            largely symbolic acts and protest tools through repetition, collective action and changes in the criminal code.
            </p>
            <p>
            The practice began as a collective effort of squatting and land-grabbing, known colloquially as self-seizing (samo-zahvat).
            It initially involved constructing tent cities where, “men, women, and even adult children shared the tasks and implemented
            a division of labor to achieve their common goal.”<a class="sup" href="#footnote15">15</a>  A former Crimean resident articulates the origins of the practice in the early 1990’s:
            </p>
            <p class="q">
            It was a mess. In agriculture, economy. Generally, there was a great deal of empty land, just like that. It started with people
            putting up tents, living there, and protesting. They cooked food, they lived right in the tents - in the spring, in the summer,
            in the autumn, when it is warm. And the authorities did not seem to react. So, on this field, people would start to divide the
            land and build. If a year has passed, year and a half, and none has reacted, people would start building houses (the ones who
            have money). Where the land is expensive, of strategic purpose, or if the authorities have plans for it, it would happen that
            the police would immediately drive up, with bulldozers, and begin to demolish it all. Several times there were severe
            confrontations, almost leading to fatalities.<a class="sup" href="#footnote16">16</a>
            </p>
            <p>
            The tactic evolved when a new version of the Criminal Code of Ukraine was adopted in 2003, introducing retroactively
            effective punishments “including fines, two years of forced work, and imprisonment—for squatting on land in Crimea.
            Moreover, special amendments to the Ukrainian Law on Militia authorized the use of dogs, chemicals, and special arms
            for the purpose of “preventing” or “liquidating” mass squatting.”<a class="sup" href="#footnote17">17</a>  In response, the Crimean occupiers renamed their
            practice from self-seizing to protest fields and continued squatting.<a class="sup" href="#footnote18">18</a>  Consequentially, the practice transformed from physically inhabiting the
            fields to simply building huts as signifiers of claimed land. Thus, the effectiveness of the built hut, as in the
            case of the barricade, shifted to rest in its performative role and symbolic function.
            </p>
            <p>
            While both barricades and protest fields are tools to claim space and challenge authorities, there
            are crucial differences between the methods. The barricades serve as barriers and obstacles, aiming to
            restrict or control physical movement, whereas protest huts signify occupation. More importantly, the
            barricades are used in inevitably violent urban warfare and are intentionally disruptive in their use and
            construction, while Crimean occupiers are intent on acting by peaceful means, and ultimately
            reproducing the safety of home. Historically, Crimeans maintain a focus on nonviolent methods of
            political protest, such as hunger strikes, organized letter-writing and public meetings and demonstrations,
            including a sit-in in Moscow’s Red Square in 1987.<a class="sup" href="#footnote19">19</a><a class="sup" href="#footnote20">20</a>
            </p>
            <p>
            We can find a comparable adherence to nonviolent tactics in Reclaim the Streets (RTS) – a
            practice that exemplifies counter-hegemonic protest through the occupation of lived space. RTS began in
            London in 1995 as part of the anti-road building movement that used the occupation of the built
            environment as a direct, non-violent action against car culture. Their tactic was to reclaim the streets of
            London by engaging in festivals, street parties or raves. Their acts blocked the road to vehicles and thus
            served as direct, bodily protest against the car. This offered “a prefigurative vision of what city streets
            could be in a system that prioritized people over profit and ecology over the economy.”<a class="sup" href="#footnote21">21</a> Another parallel
            can be found in the Occupy Wall Street movement which peaked in 2011. As stated by a former protester
            in Occupy Wall Street, “often the tactics of occupation generally serve two functions: to disrupt the
            working order, or to make visible a hidden grievance.”<a class="sup" href="#footnote22">22</a> The protest field strategy clearly and vividly
            fulfills the latter function – the huts dot the fields of Crimea as monuments that make visible historically
            persistent acts of violence, injustice and pain, thus inscribing protest onto the landscape. Meanwhile, the
            strategy’s role in disrupting the established order is more complex and requires closer examination.
            Crimean occupiers are disrupting the established order while simultaneously trying to inscribe themselves
            within it. Their prefigurative vision is not that of a revolution, nor of a Utopia; it does not aim to
            overthrow the state or the working order. Instead, it is a vision of inclusion into the existing social fabric,
            of space claimed within it.

            <p>
            The fields’ formal and spatial configuration exhibits a strong bond to the prevailing organization of space.
            Rather than proposing new models of constructing or experiencing the built environment, as in the case of RTS,
            Crimean occupiers are desperately trying to recreate present authorized forms of settlement. By adhering to a
            strict grid-like, repeatable and uniform planning, they informally duplicate the typical act of subdivision used
            in contemporary official housing development. In this aerial view <a class="fig" href="#figure2">[Figure 2]</a>, we can recognize the protest
            field as an act of filling in, as a logical continuation of the surrounding authorized residential parcels.
            </p>
            <p>
            This monotonous construction of housing emerges in stark contrast to a lost vernacular architectural diversity
            that once prevailed in the territory. Prior to the annexation of Crimea by the Russian Empire in 1783, the Crimean
            built environment exhibited great irregularity in planning and architecture, due to the variability of local
            landscape and the influence of different Crimean tribes, such as the Tats, Nogais and Yaliboyu.<a class="sup" href="#footnote23">23</a> Crimeans traditionally
            built homes congruent with the landscape forms and irregularities. For example, the nineteenth-century traveler
            Edward Clarke described the mountain Crimeans’ tendency to have their dwellings buried in foliage, while other
            travelers mentioned their “habit of building their houses into the earth on the sides of terraced mountains.”<a class="sup" href="#footnote24">24</a>
            The steppe regions of Crimea featured irregular streets and arrangement of housing.<a class="sup" href="#footnote25">25</a> The coastal zones in the south
            were distinguished by disorderly, multi-level structures, which included “crooked stone staircases in
            narrow spaces between houses, which [were] piled one above the other; the courtyard [was] sometimes
            located directly on the roof of the underlying house.”<a class="sup" href="#footnote26">26</a>
            </p>
            <p>
            Russian rule significantly disrupted the peninsula’s existing architectural development, which is
            most dramatically evident in Muslim religious architecture. Mass destruction of monuments and
            mosques, as well as a discontinuance of state funding, resulted in a severe decline in the development
            and typological diversity of local religious constructions.<a class="sup" href="#footnote27">27</a> Tsarist repression of the peninsula’s Muslim
            faith also resulted in mass (forced and willing) emigrations of Crimeans, for whom national identity was
            tied strongly to religion rather than territory. In fact, a coherent Crimean identify was formulated
            precisely in response to the foreign invasion, as the local tribes began to develop a sense of political,
            cultural and linguistic unity. Moreover, the very concept of territorially-bound national identity was
            imported from the Russian Empire:
            </p>
            <p class="q">
            Prior to the late 19th century, there had been no well-articulated political theory among the
            Crimean Tatars which proclaimed their unique claim to, and identification with a particular
            unit as a national homeland…Bernard Lewis writes, ‘The use of the word watan (Turkish
            vatan) in a political sense, equivalent to the French patrie…dates from the late eighteenth
            century, and is clearly due to European influence and example.’<a class="sup" href="#footnote28">28</a>
            </p>
            <p>
            Younger generations of Tatars, educated and inspired by Russian intelligentsia and nationalists, promoted the
            attachment of national identity to the physical landscape of the Crimean Peninsula. This territorial identification
            was carried through and further consolidated during the Soviet rule, until the 1944 deportation, which marked a
            decisive severing of a direct connection to the land.
            </p>
            <p>
            The diversity that was once expressed through architecture became a sort of outside entity, which, upon return, began to
            express itself in a uniform way. The typical execution of a protest field remains as follows: first, a group of Crimeans
            is formed, usually from residents of the same village, living in multi-family houses. Then, as one ethnic Crimean describes:
            </p>
            <p class="q">
            They choose a neighbouring field and there they go, spontaneously – no one would touch a crowd. 100 people. They make
            arrangements and negotiate and go, with measuring tapes, with ropes, pegs, axes, hammers – they reach the field and start:
            so, here will be the street, and here will be plots of 6 or 8 acres. Measure and divide, measure and divide. They position the pegs,
            tie the ropes. And immediately, so that everything would not be demolished, they start to deliver the stone and build the huts –
            everything is done in a few days, a week maximum. Before the authorities come to their senses.<a class="sup" href="#footnote29">29</a>
            </p>
            <p>
            What results is a rough but often consistent grid of huts. Depending on the situation, full houses are gradually built up in
            place of the huts, roads are made, or the field can remain in this starting state for months or years. The constructed grid
            of even lots and uniform dwellings appear as ghosts of a once rich diversity. Crimean occupiers’ informal re-enactment of
            residential subdivision and their appropriation of urban planning vocabulary are pleas for acceptance and integration into
            the working order. At the same time, through this massive collective effort, they are taking over the role of the official
            property developer. Thus, their aims to include themselves into an established cultural fabric become acts capable of
            disrupting or reconstituting social dynamics.

            The recent annexation of the Crimean Peninsula from Ukraine by the Russian Federation in 2014, profoundly complicates
            the protest field strategy’s social, political and symbolic significance. In the currently Russian-occupied territory,
            the protest field becomes an increasingly loaded act, charged with multiple levels of tragedy and experience of displacement.
            It is now not only a protest against a former abuse and an absence of reparation, but a simultaneous counter-occupation on a
            micro scale, engaging with multiple layers of violence.
            </p>
            <p>
            The Crimean Tatar strategy of claiming land through constructing protest fields in the Crimean territory is both a subversive
            practice and a plea for acceptance into the established order. The protest huts function as monuments, placeholders for
            completeness, performative acts of disruption and nonviolent tactics of claiming a home. By inscribing protest onto the local
            landscape, Crimeans are attempting to create security on the levels of the body, the shelter, and the territory. The fields
            operate simultaneously within the realms of the physical (material, bodily, structural), the symbolic and the social/political.
            Displacement, placelessness, and precarity are well recognized conditions of the current moment. Histories of displacement, as
            well as strategies to counter them form the everyday of our landscape. There is clear urgency for new and constantly evolving
            strategies to reclaim agency within our built environment.
